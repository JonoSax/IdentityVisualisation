This environment contains: 

* MultiDimAttributeAnalysis.py: This is the script which takes in inputs from the excel file (whatever is used for entitlement analysis), caluculates the similarity matrix and visualises the results.

* requirements.txt: contains the libraries required for this to be installed.

* runme.sh: this shell script will create the virtual environment, install the libraries and compile the script into an executable which can then be moved to the same directory as the excel file.

* compile.sh: this shell script exclusively compiles the py script into a single file executable.

Hi! 

I'm Jono, a Senior Analyst in the Cyber team, New Zealand. 

This folder contains three videos which supplement to the PwC solvers challenge:

1 - What is identity data (3min): Useful information if you haven't worked with identity data before and if you want to understand the underlying problem this solution is trying to solve (taking hard to read, complex data and turning it into something useful)

2 - What is the IDVisualiser (4min): This introduces my solution and shows the fundamental information which is being presented. 

3 - What does the IDVisualiser do (13min): This video shows demonstrates how this tool would be used, the capabilities of the tools in depth and the implications of the outputs. 

If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me on jono.x.reshef@pwc.com

Thank you for your time
